Notes:
GROUP BY - groups rows that have the same values into summary rows
E.g. "total number of sales by each item"
Note: If you have an aggregate function, you need to include every column that's
not aggregated (if not it gives an error)

Ex:
SELECT
	job_title_short AS Jobs,
	AVG(salary_year_avg) AS salary_avg,
	MIN(salary_year_avg) AS salary_min,
	MAX(salary_year_avg) AS salary_max
FROM 
	job_postings_fact
GROUP BY
	job_title_short
ORDER BY
	salary_avg;
