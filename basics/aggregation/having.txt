HAVING
	AVG(salary_year_avg) > 75000
Notes:
HAVING - filter query based on aggregate functions and groupings
Used because you can't use aggregate functions in WHERE
Ex:
SELECT 
	job_title_short AS Jobs,
	COUNT(job_title_short) AS job_count, 
	AVG(salary_year_avg) AS salary_avg,
	MIN(salary_year_avg) AS salary_min,
	MAX(salary_year_avg) AS salary_max
FROM 
	job_postings_fact
GROUP BY
	job_title_short
HAVING
	COUNT(job_title_short) > 100
ORDER BY
	salary_avg;
