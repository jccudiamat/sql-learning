AND
ex: WHERE
	salary_year_avg > 100000 AND 
	job_title = 'Data Analyst'
Notes:
AND - only shows records where all contributions are true
Can have multiple AND conditions

OR 
ex: WHERE
	salary_year_avg > 100000 OR 
	job_title = 'Data Analyst'
OR - only shows records when any of the conditions are true
Can have multiple OR conditions

BETWEEN
ex: WHERE
	salary_year_avg BETWEEN 60000 AND 90000
Notes: 
Used more in numeric data
BETWEEN - gets values within  a given range
Alternative to using AND, <= and >=
	e.g., salary_year_avg >= 60000 AND salary_year_avg <= 80000

IN 
ex: WHERE
	job_location IN ('Boston, MA', 'Anywhere')
Notes:
Used more in text data
IN - specify multiple values in a WHERE clause
Alternative to using OR operator
	e.g. job_location = 'Boston, MA' OR job_location = 'Anywhere'
