Question:
We're going to check that all skills do not have a category assigned to it. This can 
be used for validating data. So, get all skills from the skills_dim table that don't
have a type classification assigned to them. Return the skill_id and skills.

Ans:

SELECT
	skill_id,
	skills,
    	type
FROM
	skills_dim
WHERE
	type IS NULL;
