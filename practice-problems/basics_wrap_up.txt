Question:
Find the average salary and number of job postings for each skill for this: 
Hint: Use LEFT JOIN to combine skills_dim, skills_job_dim, and job_postings_fact tables.
Why? Understand the demand and pay for skills

Solution:
SELECT
	skills_job.skill_id,
	skill.skills,
    jobs.job_title_short,
    COUNT(jobs.job_title_short) AS 'Job Count',
    AVG(jobs.salary_year_avg) AS 'Average Salary'
FROM 
	job_postings_fact as jobs
LEFT JOIN 
	skills_job_dim as skills_job ON 
	jobs.job_id = skills_job.job_id
LEFT JOIN
	skills_dim as skill ON
	skills_job.skill_id = skill.skill_id
WHERE 
	skills_job.skill_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
	skill.skills

OR

SELECT 
	skill.skills AS skill_name,
	COUNT(skills_to_job.job_id) AS number_of_job_postings,
	AVG(job_postings.salary_year_avg) AS average_salary_for_skill
FROM 
	skills_dim AS skill
LEFT JOIN
	skills_job_dim AS skills_to_job ON
	skill.skill_id = skills_to_job.skill_id
LEFT JOIN
	job_postings_fact as job_postings ON
	skills_to_job.job_id = job_postings.job_id
GROUP BY
	skill.skills
