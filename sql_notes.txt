SQL - Structured Query Language 

SELECT - identifies the columns (or data) from a database
Select Specific columns 
Notes: Only get certain columns. Makes it easier to read the results(aka aren't you overwhelmed with all the columns)

FROM - identifies the table we are connecting to
* - special command to select all the columns
 

DISTINCT - select unique datas/no repetition
ex: SELECT DISTINCT
	job_title_short 
FROM 
	job_postings_fact;
SELECT DISTINCT
	salary_year_avg
FROM
	job_postings_fact;

WHERE - sets condition for the query. Filter out the query
ex: job_title = 'Data Analyst'

COMMENTS - --Single Line Comment 
notes: -- -a single line comment(most common)
Why? 
Helps make the query more readable
Document your query
Write short comment, like at the end of your line
/**/ MULTI-LINE COMMENT

ORDER BY - aggragate the data 
ex: ASC, DESC

LIMIT - 

Order to write commands
SELECT column1,column2,...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC]...
LIMIT number;
